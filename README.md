## Description

CIH is one of the methods used to solve the ATSP problem. The ATSP (Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem) is a classic problem that seeks to find the shortest route typically traveled by salespeople or postal workers who wish to visit several cities without revisiting any city more than once.

If the number of cities to be visited is small, this problem can be solved easily. However, it becomes challenging when the number of cities to be visited is 100 or more. Therefore, with the help of computers, the ATSP problem can be solved quickly by implementing the CIH (Cheapest Insertion Heuristic) algorithm.

This source code is an example of implementing the CIH algorithm using Borland Delphi.
